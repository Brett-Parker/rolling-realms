# [Rolling Realms](https://rolling-realms.netlify.app/)

## A fan-made, web-based version of Stonemaier Games' living roll-and-write game

> In the early days of the coronavirus, a time of self-isolation for many people, Jamey decided to create an infinitely scaling roll-and-write game to teach and play with people around the world via Facebook Live.
>
> In Rolling Realms, players compete to earn the most stars in a series of minigames over 3 rounds. This is a roll-and-write game, meaning that players will write on the game components using dry-erase markers.
>
> Each turn, one player rolls 2 dice, and all players use the dice results on their realm cards to generate resources and earn stars. After 3 rounds, the player with the most stars wins!

Back when coronavirus began, many of us were looking for projects to take on. I was just learning React and was inspired by Jamey Stegmaier's Rolling Realms to start my own project, so that those of us without printers (or just fresh out of ink) could join in and play Rolling Realms from the comfort of our screens. So I did! And Jamey liked it enough to share it with the world.

Now Rolling Realms is a real published board game, and the Rolling Realms React app is a bit more polished (and mobile friendly) than it was at the beginning.

While I'm still working on polishing the app to grow my React skills (with the help of a kind contributor), the intention is to keep it pretty much as-is besides quality-of-life improvements. If you're interested in contributing, [send me a message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jwzdyn) and we can talk about it!

While you're at it, show some love to Stonemaier Games and buy or print-and-play the physical game here: https://stonemaiergames.com/games/rolling-realms/

Stay cool,<br />

# Now for the boring Create React App boilerplate!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
